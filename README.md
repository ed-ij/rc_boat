rc_boat
=======

Programs and scripts that I made to control a remote control boat (which used a Raspberry Pi as its 'brain') from another Raspberry Pi.

Codes in this repository are not yet finished entirely but to my knowledge do still work, hopefully will be finished very soon!

The code needed in the final controller are:
    
    jscode.c
    
    serialtransmit.py
    
The code needed in the final boat are:
    
    serialrcv.py
    
    gpiopwm.c
    
All other codes provided in this repository are for testing parts, devellopment and debugging purposes only.
